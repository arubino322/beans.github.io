## Motivation
I've had a budding interest in car usage, traffic, and motor vehicle safety ever since moving to a city where cars aren't the #1 mode of transportation. The Vision Zero safety project (<https://www.nyc.gov/content/visionzero/pages/>) sheds light on crashes and injuries by collecting data such as the total number of collisions that happen per day, the cause, people involved, vehicle types, and other data points. The goal of the program is to change "the culture on our streets through a comprehensive program of engineering, educations, and enforcement."

It wasn't until my 9th year in NYC where I witnessed a fairly serious car crash with a young woman riding her scooter on the street. I take it back - I technically didn't witness the crash. I heard the car hitting the woman, the woman smacking the ground, and I saw the aftermath. The young woman was laying motionless underneath the car. Luckily the driver stopped, and several onlookers approached the crash scene to make sure the victim was responsive (luckily she was), and called 911. Days later I couldn't stop thinking about the victim, and it made me question whether or not the Vision Zero data showed an actual improvement in car safety over time.

## What I wanted to do
In the hopes of drawing inspiration from real life events or interests, I thought building a basic app that visualized the crashes over time might enlighten me, and anyone interested, with the overall state of car safety. I hope this by no means gets misconstrued as another tech bro trying to save the world with a lost sense of reality. I wanted to download some data, allow users to visualize the trend of traffic related incidents over time, and make a conclusion for themselves. Because I love maps, I wanted to visualize the location of each accident on a given day. The cherry on top, in my quest to learn more about machine learning operations (MLOps), was to attempt to predict the number of accidents that might happen on the most recent day of data I downloaded, and compare it with the actual number of collisions.

## How I thought it was gonna go
I don't want to say that I thought it was gonna be easier than it was - I know I have so much to learn, and part of the reason of doing this project was to learn new tools and ideas. But I thought that two things would happen:
1. I'd finish it faster than I did
2. ChatGPT was going to be more helpful than it was (the pitfalls of vibecoding are real)

## How it actually went
Every step of the process had unexpected challenges:
- NYC makes the Vision Zero data available for recent dates, but it's often incomplete. Data seems to be reconciled and corrected over time, which means that if you want valuable information to potentially add as a feature into a machine learning model, you'll have to wait. (I found that it might take up to 60 days for data like vehicle type, address, lat/long, people involved to be made available). My response to this was instead of updating recent data stored in BigQuery, I only pull data as of 60 days ago each day.
- I wanted to visualize crashes, but what's the best way to do this? Plotting hundreds of points on a map of NYC is kinda cool, but I didn't find it to show a general pattern of where a crash might occur (admittedly, I am probably wrong about this, and there are almost certainly more intersections and highways where crashes occur). But looking on a map was probably not the best way to deduce this, and if you filtered on more than 1 day of data, then the map is littered with points that make it hard to render and understand. I chose to only filter on one day (the end date), and although it might not be super insighful, I like maps so I kept it.
- Meta's time series python library Prophet (https://github.com/facebook/prophet) was easy implement, albeit my model only had a date feature to predict the number of crashes. Truth be told, I did not want to spend so much time fine-tuning an ML model, and I know that the study of time series models can make up the majority of a practitioner's time in and of itself, but getting predictions out there based on a few years worth of training data felt good enough. Recreating the model every day to take in new data, saving the model in GCS, and using the most recent model to make a model prediction on the most recent day of data I pulled was challenging, but probably easier than understanding the nuances of the data itself.
- Docker, building & deploying, where to host the app (Google Cloud Run? Streamlit?) are subjects I have so much to learn about. This was the portion of this project where my laziness outweighed my desire to actually understand how deploying my app worked. I suppose it's easy to blame ChatGPT for it's misdirection (and probably my poor prompting skills), but had I spent a bit more time doing more research and reading Streamlit documentation, I likely would have a had a deployed app weeks before I actually did.

## What I learned
I learned how much more I have to learn. I learned to try to be kind to myself - my initial thoughts when I can't seem to figure something out is often belittling myself. At the end of each time I got myself to sit down in front my monitor and actually do a little work, I tried to reassure myself that I'm learning! Albeit slowly #slowlearner. And eventually, I'll get this.

About the data itself, I learned that there was actual change in overall number of crashes in New York. However, it was likely less due to any regulation imposed by the government because of Vision Zero data, and moreso because congestion pricing took effect in January 2025. There is a clear decline in the average number of accidents starting this year, and if there's any reason to support congestion pricing, it's because of increase in safety to drivers and pedestrians.

## What's next
Improvements in overall traffic safety will always interest me in some way. But my overall goal is be consistent with applying machine learning operations and software engineering practices to subjects that interest and inspire me. What's next, I haven't decided, but I hope to see you soon.
